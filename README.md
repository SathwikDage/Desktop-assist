# Desktop-assist
It's just a conversation between desktop and user with two functionalities.
1)Whenever it hears "weather" in the speech it ask's which city(Hyderabad/Delhi/Chennai/Moscow...) and tells the temperature and humidity of that city where the data is extracted from the "weather.api" by webscraping.
2)Whenever it hears "search" it asks for the input that reads the data of first few lines of what is present in the google.

We are using different modules like pyttsx3 , speech_recognition, scraping modules and json....etc ..
